About Dataset
Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as
manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting
data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.
Here is a dataset we collected from a Fashion and Beauty startup. The dataset is based on the supply
chain of Makeup products. Below are all the features in the dataset:
● Product Type
● SKU
● Price
● Availability
● Number of products sold
● Revenue generated
● Customer demographics
● Stock levels
● Lead times
● Order quantities
● Shipping times
● Shipping carriers
● Shipping costs
● Supplier name
● Location
● Lead time
● Production volumes


Dataset Preparation:
○ Ensure that your dataset contains all the columns mentioned: Product Type, SKU,
Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated,
Customer demographics, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities,
Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs, Supplier name,
Location, Lead time, Production volumes, Manufacturing lead time,
Manufacturing costs, Inspection results, Defect rates, Transportation
modes, Routes, Costs.

2. Create the following visualizations:
1. Product Performance Dashboard:
○ Product Sales: Create a bar chart showing Number of products sold for each
Product Type.
○ Revenue Analysis: Create a line chart showing Revenue generated over time. Filter by
Product Type to see how different products are performing.
○ Price Distribution: Use a histogram to show the distribution of Price for different
Product Types.
○ Stock Levels: Create a heat map to visualize Stock levels across different SKU and
Product Type.

3. Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard:
○ Lead Times vs. Order Quantities: Use a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between
Lead times and Order quantities across different Supplier names.
○ Shipping Costs by Carrier: Create a bar chart showing Shipping costs per Shipping
carrier. Filter by Location to see regional differences.
○ Manufacturing Efficiency: Create a dual-axis chart with Manufacturing lead time on
one axis and Production volumes on the other to analyze manufacturing efficiency over
time.
○ Defect Rates: Create a pie chart or a bar chart to visualize Defect rates by Supplier
name or Location.

5. Customer Demographics:
○ Demographic Breakdown: Create a demographic distribution chart (such as a pie chart or
stacked bar chart) to show the breakdown of customers by age group, gender, or other
available demographics.
○ Revenue by Demographics: Use a treemap to show Revenue generated segmented
by Customer demographics.

7. Analysis Questions:
○ Which Product Type generates the highest revenue?
○ Are there any significant correlations between Lead times and Order quantities?
○ How do Shipping costs vary by Shipping carrier and Location?
○ Which suppliers have the most efficient manufacturing processes based on

9. Manufacturing lead time and Production volumes?
○ What demographic group contributes the most to sales?
● Manufacturing lead time
● Manufacturing costs
● Inspection results
● Defect rates
● Transportation modes
● Routes
● Costs
